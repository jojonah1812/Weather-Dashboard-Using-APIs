# Weather-Dashboard-Using-APIs

### Designer Name
* Jonah Haase

## Project Description
* Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Our challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
